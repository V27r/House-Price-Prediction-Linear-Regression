# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project predicts house prices using machine learning regression models. It uses the dataset from the Kaggle competition "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques."

## Files Included
- `house_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- `house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques.zip/`: Directory where the extracted CSV files (`train.csv` and `test.csv`) are stored.

## Usage
1. Open and run the `house_price_prediction.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.
2. Follow the steps to:
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Explore data through visualizations and statistical summaries.
   - Train and evaluate regression model (`LinearRegression`).
   - Make predictions on the test dataset.
   - Evaluate model performance using cross-validation and metrics like RMSE.
   - Visualize results and interpret model insights.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
